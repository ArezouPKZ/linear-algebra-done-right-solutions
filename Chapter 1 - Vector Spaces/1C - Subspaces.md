_Exercise 10_

Clearly $0 \in U_1 \cap U_2$.

Suppose $u, w \in U_1 \cap U_2$.
It follows that $u, w \in U_1$.
Because $U_1$ is closed under addition, $u + w \in U_1$.
Likewise, $u + w \in U_2$.
Hence $u + w \in U_1 \cap U_2$ and $U_1 \cap U_2$ is closed under addtion.

Similarly $U_1 \cap U_2$ is closed under scalar multiplication, therefore it is a subspace of $V$.
